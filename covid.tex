The following COVID-19 risks have been considered for the Student Robotics Competition. 
This assessment is to be supplimented by the SUSU risk assessment.
Further description of the meaning of risk ratings (presented in this section as

All severities are deemed to be `3 day' injury/illness.
Current guidance advises isolating for 5 days, this is understood to be to prevent spreading rather than severity related.
