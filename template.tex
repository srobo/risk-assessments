\section*{Assessment Guidance}

Each hazard is assigned a number between 1 and 3 indicating the likelihood of
the hazard affecting a person:
\begin{description}
    \item[Low (1):] May only occur in exceptional circumstances
    \item[Medium (2):] Might occur in some circumstances
    \item[High (3):] Will likely occur in most circumstances
\end{description}

Similarly, each hazard is assigned a number between 1 and 3 indicating the
magnitude of the impact that the hazard would have, if it did occur:
\begin{description}
    \item[Low (1):] Superficial or minor injury. Can usually be handled by local
    first aid procedures.
    \item[Medium (2):] Serious injury, possibly resulting in hospitalisation for
    up to three days. Complete recovery/rehabilitation could take several months.
    \item[High (3):] Major or fatal injury. Requires extensive medical treatment,
    including at least three days in hospital.
\end{description}

The hazard's \emph{risk level} is then calculated to be the likelihood rating
multiplied by the impact rating. For example, a hazard that is likely to occur
in almost all circumstances but only results in a minor injury would have a
likelihood rating of $3$, an impact rating of $1$, and an overall risk level of
$3 \times 1 = 3$.

These guidelines are based on those provided in the University of Southampton
Student Union's risk assessment template.
